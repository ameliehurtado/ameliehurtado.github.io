<h1 class="reverse">about me</h1>
<p>
My favorite things to do are watch Netflix, read books, eat, and online shop. Sadly, those are about the only hobbies I have. My favorite places in the world are my bedroom and the bookstore. I like opossums because they are cute, and so are hairless dogs and cats.
